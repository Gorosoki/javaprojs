     "Well, well!" said an old woman, peering out with a crafty look. "And haven't you children a sweet tooth?" 

     "Come in! Come in, you've nothing to fear!" went on the old woman. Unluckily for Hansel and Gretel, however, the sugar candy cottage belonged to an old witch, her trap for catching unwary victims. The two children had come to a really nasty place. 

     "You're nothing but skin and bones!" said the witch, locking Hansel into a cage. I shall fatten you up and eat you!" 

     "You can do the housework," she told Gretel grimly, "then I'll make a meal of you too!" As luck would have it, the witch had very bad eyesight, an when Gretel smeared butter on her glasses, she could see even less. 

     "Let me feel your finger!" said the witch to Hansel every day to check if he was getting any fatter. Now, Gretel had brought her brother a chicken bone, and when the witch went to touch his finger, Hansel held out the bone. 

     "You're still much too thin!" she complained. When will you become plump?" One day the witch grew tired of waiting.
